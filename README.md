# Clustering the Districts of Munich

This was my first personal final project for Coursera IBM Data Science specialization. 

The project revolves around using unsupervised learning to cluster the neighborhoods of Munich in a way that makes sense.

My tasks for this project were:

- Scrape the Munich city portal for the district name - postcode pairs
- Make calls to the Google Maps API to create a DataFrame with district names, postcodes, and their latitudes and longitudes
- Create Folium maps to visualize the districts
- Clean up the DataFrame
- Make calls to the FourSquare API to retrieve the venues in each district
- Try out different distance metrics and algorithms (KDTree vs. BallTre) to determine cluster radii
- Explore the data through visualizations and rankings
- Cluster the data with KMeans to obtain a meaningful represantation of the city
